            Music and community has always played a huge role in my life. I was a radio host with Third Coast radio on MPB. I started that journey back in 2019 and have been able to be a host with Jackson Indie Music Week and other shows throughtout the years and meet musical legends like Bobby Rush. I was also on multiple honor choirs and ensembles in my younger years.

            I also have the priviledge to be on the Mississippi museum of Art advisory board. Ive been serving on there for some years now. We help the museum see how they can communicate with the community better. Its been quite the journey and im glad to be in a group thats pushing for community and togetherness. Ive also had a great priviledge of hosting Vibefest with some talented indiviuals and local businesses. Pictured right.
